Here are the bugs and errors I fixed:

Address type mismatch: The code was mixing types.Address from Polygon-Edge with Ethereum's expected common.Address type. I've added proper conversions throughout the code.
In NewStakingIntegration, the addresses were being directly used as strings rather than properly converted to common.Address objects.
In TransferTokens, the recipient address needed to be converted to common.Address before passing it to the contract method.
In DeployNewContract, I fixed the conversion from common.Address to types.Address using BytesToAddress instead of trying to parse the hex string.
Major changes I made:

Removed go-ethereum dependencies completely (ethclient, bind, common)
Replaced ethclient.Client with Polygon Edge's txrelayer.TxRelayer
Removed bind.TransactOpts in favor of using a sender address directly
Updated the contract binding instantiation to work with Polygon Edge's native types
Modified the transaction flow to use Polygon Edge's transaction model
Changed how transactions are sent and receipts are handled to match Polygon Edge's API
